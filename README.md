and most recently

-leahsportfolio

Space Station:
This project helped me understand how to use CSS within a navbar, images, containers and a form. This is a page for training and not operational.

Movie Theater:
This project helped me understand how to use Bootstrap and all the stylings it can provide. I really enjoyed learning how to implement the jumbotron, forms, cards and more. This is also a training page and also not operational.

leahsportfolio:
This is my latest project file and I hope to use it live in the future, if not this exact one, it will mirror alot of it, and so I will be paying special attention to all the details.
